# Portuguese Bank Marketing Data Analysis

Running a machine learning analysis on Portuguese bank data to evaluate a customer's likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.

## Summary

Data exploration, feature engineering and building a machine learning model. Evaluate dataset using F1 Score/Confusion Matrix/Accuracy Score. Evaluate subscription likelihood using a Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm and compared the accuracy score.

## Approach

1. Exploratory analysis of the dataset itself, evaluating the types of data available, examining the data types separately.

2. Evaluate the distribution of the variables: age, marital status, pdays, consumer price indices etc. using violin plots and histograms.

3. Apply dummy variables for the categorical data (job, marital, education, poutcome).

4. Map boolean data to 1 & 0.

5. Cleanse N/A values.

6. Split data into training and test sets.

8. Applying Logistic Regression Model. 

9. Applying the NB model and print the accuracy of NB model. 

10. Comparing the accuracy score of both the moedels.
